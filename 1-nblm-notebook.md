# Getting Started with NotebookLM's _Notebook Guide_ 
<img src="images/5-notebooklm-logo.png" style="float:right;width:350px;padding:10px;" alt="NoteboolLM Logo">
"Upload PDFs, websites, YouTube videos, audio files, Google Docs, or Google Slides, and NotebookLM will summarize them and make interesting connections between topics. With all of your sources in place, NotebookLM gets to work and becomes a personalized AI expert in the information that matters most to you. NotebookLM provides clear citations for its work, showing you the exact quotes from your sources. NotebookLM does not use your personal data, including your source uploads, queries, and the responses from the model for training." ([NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/){:target="_blank"}, 2024)

> NOTE: Like all other Generative AI tools, NotebookLM will sometimes make mistakes, although because you are providing it with training data, it will likely make fewer mistakes than general purpose Generative AI tools. Always research any factual claims it makes if you are not a subject area expert. 

If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.

## Logon to NotebookLM
- If you haven't already, please navigate to the [NoteBookLM website](https://notebooklm.google/){:target="_blank"}.

## Create a Notebook & Add Documents to It
Before we can start testing, we need to create a new notebook and add some documents and media to it so that it has some source documents to train on and draw from.

1. Download each of the following three documents to use as training data for your notebook in this activity, and please make note of where your web browser is saving them (usually in your Downloads or Desktop folders):
   - [Document 1](images/badge-article.pdf){:target="_blank"}
   - [Document 2](images/badge-article-2.pdf){:target="_blank"}
   - [Document 3](images/badge-article-3.pdf){:target="_blank"}
2. Create a new notebook by clicking on the blue **Create** button.
<img src="images/nblm-create.png" style="width:600px;padding:10px;border: 1px solid #555;" alt="NotebookLM Create new button"><br>
3. Upload the three documents you downloaded by clicking on the blue **choose file** link in the middle of the page.
<img src="images/nblm-add-docs.gif" style="width:800px;padding:10px;border: 1px solid #555;" alt="Add documents"><br>
4. Good job! You're now ready to explore the Notebook guide.
   
## Exploring the Notebook Guide 
1. Each individual article will have a summary when you click it on the left side pannel of the sources.
   - For all 3 articles it will be visible (see photo example), the sentence starts with Three sources explore the use of digital badges in education and professional development... An expert in informal credentialling (or badging) has reviewed the summary, and it is an accurate summary of the information contained in the three journal articles.
<img src="images/nblm-summary.png" style="width:600px;padding:10px;border: 1px solid #555;" alt="Summary"><br>
> **NOTE: You should always double-check the accuracy of the facts and claims made by NotebookLM (and all other GenAI tools), as they sometimes make mistakes or hallucinate.
> Note: There are several minor hallucinations in the Notebook Guide. The notebook guides DOES NOT provide citations that can be easily fact-check making it more difficult to verify its facts and claims.**
2. **Podcast Summary**:
  - To create a podcast summary, all you need to do is click on the blue **Generate** button **-OR-** You can also click on the **Customize** button to give NoteBookLM more context before it generates the podcast summary. For example you can click on the Customize button and type: ```The audience for this podcast are parents who are sending a child to university for the first time, and are concerned about the job prospects for their child after graduation.```
  - It typically takes between two and five minutes to generate the podcast, and the podcasts seem to be about 10 to 18 minutes long depending on how much information it needs to summarize.<br>
<img src="images/nblm-generate-podcast.png" style="width:400px;padding:10px;border: 1px solid #555;" alt="NotebookLM Generate Podcast button"><br>
  - Once the podcast has been generated, you can listen to the podcast by clicking on the light blue play button.
  - To download the podcast to your computer to share with other people click on the **three vertical dots** to the right of the play button and then click on the **Download** button.
  - If you don't want to wait for NotebookLM to create the podcast you can listen to the version it created for the DSC: [Podcast Summary Audio](images/nblm-podcast-summary.mp3){:target="_blank"} (12-min).

  > - **Reflection**: Are there any potential drawbacks or problems you can think of with this type of GenAI-created Podcast summary?
3. **Briefing Document**:
  - Briefing documents are a quick way to understand the contents of the documents in your notebook. **NOTE**: NotebookLM does not provide inline citations in this type of document like it does when it responds to your prompts, which makes verifying factual claims more time-consuming.
  - To create a briefing document simply click on the **breifing doc** button. It will take 30-60 seconds to generate the briefing guide unnder notes (this will be titled a Digital Badges: Comprehensive Overview).<br>

6. **Study Guide**:
  - Study guides are a great way to test your knowledge of a topic using GenAI-generated short answer questions with the answers to those questions available to you to check to see how you did.
  - The study guide also contains essay questions, with no answers, and a glossary of terms that could potentially be quite helpful.
  - To create a study guide simply click on the **Study Guide** button. It will take 30-60 seconds to generate the study guide.<br>

7. **Timeline**:

  - To create a timeline simply click on the **Timeline** button. It will take 30-60 seconds to generate the timeline.<br>
