"Upload PDFs, websites, YouTube videos, audio files, Google Docs, or Google Slides, and NotebookLM will summarize them and make interesting connections between topics. With all of your sources in place, NotebookLM gets to work and becomes a personalized AI expert in the information that matters most to you. NotebookLM provides clear citations for its work, showing you the exact quotes from your sources. NotebookLM does not use your personal data, including your source uploads, queries, and the responses from the model for training." ([NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/){:target="_blank"}, 2024)

Like all other Generative AI tools, NotebookLM will sometimes make mistakes, although because you are providing it with training data, it will make fewer mistakes than general purpose Generative AI tools. Always double-check any factual claims it makes if you are not a subject area expert. 

If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this GPT4All exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.

## Create a Notebook & Add Documents & Media to It
1. Before we can start testing, we need to tell GPT4All that we want to use the _Llama 3 Instruct_ model:
  - Click on the **Home** button on the top left of the screen.
  - Click on the green **Find Models** button on the **Home** screen.

  - Select **Llama 3 Instruct** model, or the _latest Llama model_ if the _Llama 3 Instruct model_ is not available. Depending on the speed of your laptop and your internet connection, it should take between 10 seconds to 10 minutes for the model to finish loading.

## Exploring the Notebook Guide
