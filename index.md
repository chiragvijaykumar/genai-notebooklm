# GenAI: NotebookLM a Personal Tool for Research & Productivity (_Intermediate_)

- Pre-workshop activities: 10 min 
- Introductory presentation: 15 min
- Active learning time: 60 min

## About the workshop 
Workshop participants will explore the use of NoteBookLM as a personal Generative AI (GenAI) tool grounded in the information you trust. “When you upload the documents central to your projects, tools like NotebookLM instantly become an expert in the information” in the documents you uploaded to them (NotebookLM.google, 2024). In the hands-on portion of the workshop, participants will explore GenAI tool usage and output evaluation for accuracy and biases. The workshop will also encourage informed, responsible cloud-based GenAI use.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Describe to a friend the fundamental capabilities of NotebookLM, including Text generation, Summarization, Translation, Question-answering
2. Notebook guide: Use the built-in prompts in the  “Notebook guide” to quickly create: Briefing documents & an Audio summary of the documents in a 2-person podcast format
3. Create Lecture or Meeting Transcription Summarizations: Prompt NotebookLM to create a summary based on who is the intended audience for the summary, and the purpose of the summary (for example meeting notes).
4. Create Research Summaries: Efficiently summarize and analyze research literature such as journal articles, reports, presentations and videos including citations. Verify all facts and claims.
7. Ideation & Brainstorming: Evaluate a group of journal articles for gaps in the literature and potential research questions to fill those gaps or explore a related topic.
8. Summarize Survey Feedback: Summarize large numbers of short-answer survey responses, to help you quickly understand the key issues being brought up by respondents. 
9. Presentation Assistance: Based on a journal article create a script along with slide titles for a Presentation with Google Slides or Microsoft PowerPoint.
