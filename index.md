# GenAI: NotebookLM a Personal RAG Tool for Research & Productivity (_Intermediate_)

- Pre-workshop activities: 10 min 
- Introductory presentation: 15 min
- Active learning time: 60 min

## About the workshop 
- This workshop focuses on using NoteBookLM, a personal Generative AI (GenAI) tool, that becomes an expert on the specific documents you provide.
- Crucially, NoteBookLM's functionality is directly dependent on the documents you upload. It uses these documents as its training data.
- Participants will engage in hands-on activities to explore GenAI tool usage and learn how to evaluate output for accuracy and potential biases, based on the uploaded documents.
- The workshop will also promote informed and responsible use of cloud-based GenAI.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Describe to a friend the fundamental capabilities of NotebookLM, including Text generation, Summarization, Translation, Question-answering
2. Notebook guide: Use the built-in prompts in the  ‚ÄúNotebook guide‚Äù to quickly create: Briefing documents & an Audio summary of the documents in a 2-person podcast format
3. Create Lecture or Meeting Transcription Summarizations: Prompt NotebookLM to create a summary based on who is the intended audience for the summary, and the purpose of the summary (for example meeting notes).
4. Create Research Summaries: Efficiently summarize and analyze research literature such as journal articles, reports, presentations and videos including citations. Verify all facts and claims.
7. Ideation & Brainstorming: Evaluate a group of journal articles for gaps in the literature and potential research questions to fill those gaps or explore a related topic.
8. Summarize Survey Feedback: Summarize large numbers of short-answer survey responses, to help you quickly understand the key issues being brought up by respondents. 
9. Presentation Assistance: Based on a journal article create a script along with slide titles for a Presentation with Google Slides or Microsoft PowerPoint.
