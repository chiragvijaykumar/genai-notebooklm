# GenAI: Personal Tools for Research & Productivity (102)

- Pre-workshop activities: 10 min 
- Introductory presentation: 15 min
- Active learning time: 60 min

## About the workshop 
Workshop participants will explore the use of Generative AI (GenAI) including installing and using local Generative AI software on a laptop, using specific documents as the training data for the GenAI tool, and performing sentiment analysis on free from survey questions. In the hands-on portion of the workshop, participants will explore GenAI tool usage and output evaluation for accuracy and biases. The workshop will also encourage informed, responsible GenAI use.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Describe to a friend the fundamental capabilities of NotebookLM, including Text generation, Summarization, Translation, Question-answering
2. Notebook guide: Use the built-in prompts in the  “Notebook guide” to quickly create: Briefing documents & an Audio summary of the documents in a 2-person podcast format
3. Summarization: Prompt NotebookLM to create a focused summary based on who the summary is for, and the purpose of the summary (for example meeting notes)
4. Literature review: Use NotebookLM to efficiently summarize and analyze research literature such as journal articles, reports, presentations and videos (with citations)
5. Brainstorming & ideation: Use NotebookLM for creative tasks, such as topic brainstorming and ideation for research topics
6. Data analysis: Prompt NotebookLM to assist with data analysis tasks, such as data cleaning, summarization, and visualization.
7. Translation: Prompt to create a focused summary in another language (if possible in a language that you can fact check in real time for accuracy)
8. Best practices: Describe the best practices for using NotebookLM, including fact-checking claims, being mindful of potential biases, & maintaining critical thinking in all phases of study and research
9. Limiting factors: 50 document limit & cloud-based privacy considerations

Optional (to be moved to the _GenAI: Research Tools Advanced_ workshop):

1. Install GenAI software on your laptop including 1 or more large language models (not cloud-based), and use it to answer a question.
2. Use the local GenAI software and select a folder of documents on your computer to use as training data; then ask questions of the documents.
3. Transcribe interviews using cloud-based AI transcription services and an AI-powered program that runs locally on your computer.
4. Use GenAI tools to conduct Sentiment Analysis on free-form survey questions or social media posts.
5. Upload an Excel spreadsheet, and then request a summary and insights from the data.
