# Teaching Resource : An Introduction to AI for K-12 Education 

Curricular Connections:
[BC Digital Literacy Framework](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/education/kindergarten-to-grade-12/teach/teaching-tools/digital-literacy-framework.pdf){:target="_blank"}, [Language Arts](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/english-language-arts/3/core){:target="_blank"} such as "stories can be understood from different perspectives." (many other litteracy connections across grade levels) and [ADST curriculum](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/adst){:target="_blank"}

1. First download the following 3 PDF documents. These documents will be used as training data for this activity for educators. Note that various stories and documents can be used to focus on similarities and differences at various grade levels. This is just an example of a well known fairytale that aligns with some of the outcomes of the BC curriculum. 
   - [Document 1](images/3-pigs-1.pdf){:target="_blank"}
   - [Document 2](images/3-pigs-2.pdf){:target="_blank"}
   - [Document 3](images/3-pigs-3.pdf){:target="_blank"}

2. Create a new notebook by clicking on **Create** button.

3. Upload the three documents you downloaded by clicking on the blue **choose file** link in the middle of the page.

4. Next, we will compare these 3 versions of the 3 little pigs. During this process you can have students do this activity on their own and make Venn diagrams or T-charts etc. You could also do this as a whole class.
5. Make sure all 3 articles are selected, then in the **start typing box**, type ```What are some similarities.```
6. You can then type ```Make a T chart```
7. You could also ask it to  ```Make a Venn diagram``` (It will share the sections of the Venn diagram and you can create the visual from there).
8. Note that this tool can also be used for comprehension and for students to seek details for example we could ask ```What materials were used to construct each pig's house?``` and it can also be used to create your own story and pull out key story elements, for instance ask NotebookLM to ```Create a plan for my own version of the 3 little pigs```
9. Great work you have completed the K-12 Educators activity! There are many other questions to ask, feel free to continue to try out the tool and ask questions to get more specific answers. Also you can add another article or unselect one, as other options.
