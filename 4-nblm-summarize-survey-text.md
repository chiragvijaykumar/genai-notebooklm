# Summarize Short Answer Survey Feedback
<img src="images/4-survey-logo.jpeg" style="float:right;width:300px;padding:10px;" alt="Decorative">
In this workshop, we'll explore how GenAI can help you summarize short answer survey responses, to help you quickly understand at a high level the key issues being brought up by respondents for a specific survey question. If you asked multiple questions you'd need to upload the responses for each question in individual documents. We'll also review how to customize these summaries by adjusting the tone, style, and language level.  

> NOTE: Like all other Generative AI tools, NotebookLM will sometimes make mistakes, although because you are providing it with training data, it will likely make fewer mistakes than general purpose Generative AI tools. Always research any factual claims it makes when summarizing survey question responses.

If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.

Outline:
- Summarize feedback from all responses to a single free-form survey question.
- Use different prompt strategies to customize the summary by using, personas, examples, tone, vocabulary level, and voice.
- Summarize feedback from a second free-form survey question.

## Getting Started
Let's go back to the notebook with the three journal articles we've already created, and add a YouTube video to the notebook so that there will be four items for NotebookLM to draw information from:

1. Download the following two documents, each with survey question responses, to use as training data for your notebook in this activity. When you do this for your own survey data, please note that you'll need to export the responses for each survey question you want to analyze into separate documents (using either TXT or PDF formats for both). Please make note of where your web browser is saving the survey response PDF files for this exercise (usually in your Downloads or Desktop folders):
   - [Survey Question Respons 1](images/survey-question-1.pdf){:target="_blank"}
   - [Survey Question Respons 2](images/survey-question-2.pdf){:target="_blank"}
2. Create a new notebook by clicking on the blue **Create new** button on the left side of the screen.
<img src="images/nblm-create-new.png" style="width:600px;padding:10px;border: 1px solid #555;" alt="NotebookLM Create new button"><br>
3. Upload the two documents you downloaded by clicking on the blue **choose file** link in the middle of the page. You'll need to either select the two documents, and add them together, or do as the video below shows and add them individually:

4. Good job! You're now ready to explore ways to summarize the survey responses!

## Initial Exploration  
1. Create a list of possible limitations or gaps in the articles and video by typing the following into the chat box and press Enter: ```What are the most significant limitations or gaps mentioned in these studies?```
  > - **Reflection**: Do the limitations and gaps look reasonable?
2. Identify some possible surprising or counterintuitive insights from the journal articles and video by typing the following into the chat box and press Enter: ```Extract 2-3 surprising or counterintuitive insights from these journal articles.```
  - **Reflection**: Are the insights supported by the citations that link to the parts of the article that support the insights?
3. Identify contradictory findings or interpretations between these journal articles. Type the following into the chat box and press Enter: ```Identify any contradictory findings or interpretations between these studies.```
  - **Reflection**: Are the contradictory findings supported by the citations?
4. Identify common themes or research questions shared by these articles. Type the following into the chat box and press Enter: ```What common themes or research questions emerge when examining these articles together?```
  - **Reflection**: Do the themes and research questions look reasonable based on what you've read in the articles?

1. Download each of the following three documents to use as training data for your notebook in this activity, and please make note of where your web browser is saving them (usually in your Downloads or Desktop folders):
   - [Document 1](images/badge-article.pdf){:target="_blank"}
   - [Document 2](images/badge-article-2.pdf){:target="_blank"}
   - [Document 3](images/badge-article-3.pdf){:target="_blank"}
2. Create a new notebook by clicking on the blue **Create new** button on the left side of the screen.
<img src="images/nblm-create-new.png" style="width:600px;padding:10px;border: 1px solid #555;" alt="NotebookLM Create new button"><br>
3. Upload the three documents you downloaded by clicking on the blue **choose file** link in the middle of the page.
<img src="images/nblm-add-docs.gif" style="width:800px;padding:10px;border: 1px solid #555;" alt="Add documents"><br>
4. Good job! You're now ready to explore the Notebook guide.
   
## ???
1. Click on the **Notebook Guide** button on the bottom right of the window. You should now see the notebook guide window.
<img src="images/nblm-summary-auto.png" style="width:800px;padding:10px;border: 1px solid #555;" alt="NotebookLM Auto Summary"><br>
   - Read the Summary that NotebookLM has created. An expert in informal credentialling (or badging) has reviewed the summary, and it is an accurate summary of the information contained in the three journal articles.
> **NOTE: You should always double-check the accuracy of the facts and claims made by NotebookLM (and all other GenAI tools), as they sometimes make mistakes or hallucinate.
> Note: There are several minor hallucinations in the Notebook Guide. The notebook guides DO NOT provide citations that allow you to easily fact-check its responses making it more difficult to verify facts and claims.**
3. **Podcast Summary**:
  - To create a podcast summary, all you need to do is click on the blue **Generate** button. It typically takes between two and five minutes to generate the podcast, and the podcasts seem to be about 10 to 18 minutes long depending on how much information it needs to summarize.<br>
<img src="images/nblm-generate-podcast.png" style="width:400px;padding:10px;border: 1px solid #555;" alt="NotebookLM Generate Podcast button"><br>
  - Once the podcast has been generated, you can listen to the podcast by clicking on teh light blue play button.
  - To download the podcast to your computer to share with other people click on the **three vertical dots** to the right of the play button and then click on the **Download** button.
  - If you don't want to wait for NotebookLM to create the podcast you can listen to the version it created for the DSC: [Podcast Summary Audio](images/nblm-podcast-summary.mp3){:target="_blank"} (12-min).
  > - **Reflection**: What do you think of the quality of the Podcast it created?
  > - **Reflection**: Can you think of any ways that this type of Podcast summary could be useful?
  > - **Reflection**: Are there any potential drawbacks or problems you can think of with this type of GenAI-created Podcast summary?
