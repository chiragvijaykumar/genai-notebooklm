In this workshop, you'll create a script and related photos for a Presentation with Google Slides or Microsoft PowerPoint... **ADD MORE HERE**

> NOTE: Like all other Generative AI tools, NotebookLM will sometimes make mistakes, although because you are providing it with training data, it will likely make fewer mistakes than general purpose Generative AI tools. Always research any factual claims it makes if you are not a subject area expert. 

If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.

## Activity Outline
- Use the notebook from the first activity with the 3 badging journal articles for this activity (explain how to get back to it?)
- In the chat box at the bottom of the page type: How useful are informal credentials in helping students find jobs?
  - Review the summary to make sure there are not mistakes or inaccuracies.
- In the chat box at the bottom of the page type: Create a google slides presentaion summary.
  - Review the presentation text to make sure there are not mistakes or inaccuracies.
- In the chat box at the bottom of the page type: Create an image for each slide.
  - Other prompt: Create an image for each slide in an abstract style, with a consistent colour pallet across all the image.
- Go to Meta.ai to create the images (as of December 2024 the free Google Gemini image creator is not nearly as good as the free Meta.ai image generator:
- Create a blank Google Slide or PowerPoint presentation:
- Reflections:
  - Would creating the text summary of the presentation save you time?
    - How much editing of the text would you need to do to get it to a quality level youâ€™d be happy with (if any)?
    - Were there any factual errors in the presentation text?
    - Are there any major points or concepts that NotebookLM missed?
  - Would creating the images for the presentation save you time?
    - Are you happy with the quality of the images?
    - What other options do you have to include imagery in your presentations?
  - What are potential moral and legal issues that the GenAI companies are dealing with about the training data they are using to create these images?

Before we can start testing, we need to create a new notebook and add some documents and media to it so that it has some source documents to train on and draw from.

1. Download each of the following three documents to use as training data for your notebook in this activity, and please make note of where your web browser is saving them (usually in your Downloads or Desktop folders):
   - [Document 1](images/badge-article.pdf){:target="_blank"}
   - [Document 2](images/badge-article-2.pdf){:target="_blank"}
   - [Document 3](images/badge-article-3.pdf){:target="_blank"}
2. Create a new notebook by clicking on the blue **Create new** button on the left side of the screen.
<img src="images/nblm-create-new.png" style="width:600px;padding:10px;border: 1px solid #555;" alt="NotebookLM Create new button"><br>
3. Upload the three documents you downloaded by clicking on the blue **choose file** link in the middle of the page.
<img src="images/nblm-add-docs.gif" style="width:800px;padding:10px;border: 1px solid #555;" alt="Add documents"><br>
4. Good job! You're now ready to explore the Notebook guide.
   
## ???
1. Click on the **Notebook Guide** button on the bottom right of the window. You should now see the notebook guide window.
<img src="images/nblm-summary-auto.png" style="width:800px;padding:10px;border: 1px solid #555;" alt="NotebookLM Auto Summary"><br>
   - Read the Summary that NotebookLM has created. An expert in informal credentialling (or badging) has reviewed the summary, and it is an accurate summary of the information contained in the three journal articles.
> **NOTE: You should always double-check the accuracy of the facts and claims made by NotebookLM (and all other GenAI tools), as they sometimes make mistakes or hallucinate.
> Note: There are several minor hallucinations in the Notebook Guide. The notebook guides DO NOT provide citations that allow you to easily fact-check its responses making it more difficult to verify facts and claims.**
3. **Podcast Summary**:
  - To create a podcast summary, all you need to do is click on the blue **Generate** button. It typically takes between two and five minutes to generate the podcast, and the podcasts seem to be about 10 to 18 minutes long depending on how much information it needs to summarize.<br>
<img src="images/nblm-generate-podcast.png" style="width:400px;padding:10px;border: 1px solid #555;" alt="NotebookLM Generate Podcast button"><br>
  - Once the podcast has been generated, you can listen to the podcast by clicking on teh light blue play button.
  - To download the podcast to your computer to share with other people click on the **three vertical dots** to the right of the play button and then click on the **Download** button.
  - If you don't want to wait for NotebookLM to create the podcast you can listen to the version it created for the DSC: [Podcast Summary Audio](images/nblm-podcast-summary.mp3){:target="_blank"} (12-min).
  > - **Reflection**: What do you think of the quality of the Podcast it created?
  > - **Reflection**: Can you think of any ways that this type of Podcast summary could be useful?
  > - **Reflection**: Are there any potential drawbacks or problems you can think of with this type of GenAI-created Podcast summary?
