In this workshop, you'll create a script along with slide titles for a Presentation with Google Slides or Microsoft PowerPoint. If you want you could also use [Meta.ai](https://www.meta.ai/){:target="_blank"} to create images that you could potentially use for your slides.

> NOTE: Like all other Generative AI tools, NotebookLM will sometimes make mistakes, although because you are providing it with training data, it will likely make fewer mistakes than general purpose Generative AI tools. Always research any factual claims it makes if you are not a subject area expert. 

If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.

## Getting Started
1. **If you completed the first activity in this workshop**: Please use the notebook from the first activity with the 3 badging journal articles. To do this:
<img src="images/5-nblm-logo.png" style="float:right;width:80px;padding:10px;" alt="NotebookLM logo">
  -  Return to the NotebookLM home page with the 3 articles by first clicking the **black circular NotebookLM logo** in the top left of the web application.
  <img src="images/5-notebook-button.png" style="float:right;width:300px;padding:10px;" alt="NotebookLM button">
  -  Next, click on the **The Digital Badge Ecosystem in Libraries** notebook to get into the notebook we'll be using for this activity.
2. **If you haven't completed the first activity**, No worries! Please complete the following first two steps of this workshop's starter activity before returning here to continue on to learn how you can use NotebookLM to assist you in creating a presentation:
  - [Logon to NotebookLM](1-nblm-notebook.html#create-a-notebook--add-documents-to-it){:target="_blank"}
  - [Create a Notebook & Add Documents to It](1-nblm-notebook.html#create-a-notebook--add-documents-to-it){:target="_blank"}

## Create Presentation Speaker Notes Based on an Article
Unlike the first activity in this workshop where we used three articles as training data, in this activity we are using only one of them to create a presentation (in either PowerPoint or Google Slides). This is to replicate a typical use case where you've written an assignment or journal article and need to create an accompanying presentation for it. Let's get started:
<img src="images/5-one-article-selected.png" style="float:right;width:300px;padding:10px;border: 1px solid #555;" alt="Only one article selected">
1. Click on the checked boxes beside, **badge-article-2.pdf** & **badge-article-3.pdf** to deselect these two articles so that NoteboolLM will only use the one remaining selected article to respond to your prompts.
2. In the chat box at the bottom of the page copy and paste the following prompt: ```Please help me create a 10 minute long presentation, with slide titles, and detailed speaker notes, with minimal text on the slides. The audience is a group of graduate students and professors. Start the presentation with an interesting and compelling story.```
3. Review the presentation text to make sure there are not mistakes or inaccuracies. As you read the text, ask yourself the following questions: 
> - What has it done well?
> - What has it not done well?
> - What mistakes had it made?
4. Click on the grey **Save to Note** button on the bottom left of the bottom left of the web page. 
<img src="images/5-save-to-note.png" style="width:600px;padding:10px;border: 1px solid #555;" alt="Save to Note button">
5. Note that after you click the Save to Note button, a new item will appear in the bottom half of the "Studio" panel on the right of the web app. The auto-generated title for my note was, "**Digital Badges: Empowering...**"
<img src="images/5-note-title.png" style="float:right;width:350px;padding:10px;border: 1px solid #555;" alt="Note title">
6. **Click** on the note, and then **Copy and Paste** the text from the note into a Word or Google Doc. Now that the presentation outline is in an editable document you can personalize the content, wording, and ordering, as well as correct any factual errors that it's made.

## Customize the Presentation
7. Prompt for a better intro story...
8. Title
3. In the chat box at the bottom of the page type: Create a Google Slides presentation summary.
  - Review the presentation text to make sure there are not mistakes or inaccuracies.
4. In the chat box at the bottom of the page type: Create an image for each slide.
  - Other prompts: Create an image for each slide in an abstract style, with a consistent colour pallet across all the images.
> - **Reflection**: Are there any potential drawbacks or problems you can think of with this type of GenAI-created Podcast summary?

   
## Create an Image for Each Slide
5. Let's go to [Meta.ai](https://www.meta.ai/){:target="_blank"} to create the images (as of December 2024 Google's free Gemini image creator is not nearly as good as the free Meta.ai image generator)
6. Prompt for the title page
7. Prompt for story page
8. Prompt for 3rd page.
 
## Reflection
> **Text generation**:
>  - Would creating the text summary of the presentation save you time? 
>  - How much editing of the text would you need to do to get it to a quality level youâ€™d be happy with (if any)?
>  - Were there any factual errors in the presentation text?
>  - Are there any major points or concepts that NotebookLM missed?
> **Image generation**:
>  - Would creating the images for the presentation save you time?
>  - Are you happy with the quality of the images?
>  - What other options do you have to include imagery in your presentations?
>  - Are there any potential moral and legal issues around the images, videos, audio and text the GenAI companies are using for training data?
