In this workshop, you'll create a script along with slide titles for a Presentation with Google Slides or Microsoft PowerPoint. If you want you could also use Meta.ai to create images that you could potentially use for your slides.

> NOTE: Like all other Generative AI tools, NotebookLM will sometimes make mistakes, although because you are providing it with training data, it will likely make fewer mistakes than general purpose Generative AI tools. Always research any factual claims it makes if you are not a subject area expert. 

If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.

## Create a Presentation Outline Based on an Article
1. Use the notebook from the first activity with the 3 badging journal articles for this activity (explain how to get back to it?)
2. In the chat box at the bottom of the page type: How useful are informal credentials in helping students find jobs?
  - Review the summary to make sure there are no mistakes or inaccuracies.
3. In the chat box at the bottom of the page type: Create a Google Slides presentation summary.
  - Review the presentation text to make sure there are not mistakes or inaccuracies.
4. In the chat box at the bottom of the page type: Create an image for each slide.
  - Other prompts: Create an image for each slide in an abstract style, with a consistent colour pallet across all the images.
> - **Reflection**: Are there any potential drawbacks or problems you can think of with this type of GenAI-created Podcast summary?

## Create Imagery for Each Slide
5. Go to Meta.ai to create the images (as of December 2024 the free Google Gemini image creator is not nearly as good as the free Meta.ai image generator:
- Create a blank Google Slide or PowerPoint presentation:
- Reflections:
  - Would creating the text summary of the presentation save you time?
    - How much editing of the text would you need to do to get it to a quality level youâ€™d be happy with (if any)?
    - Were there any factual errors in the presentation text?
    - Are there any major points or concepts that NotebookLM missed?
  - Would creating the images for the presentation save you time?
    - Are you happy with the quality of the images?
    - What other options do you have to include imagery in your presentations?
  - What are potential moral and legal issues that the GenAI companies are dealing with about the training data they are using to create these images?
