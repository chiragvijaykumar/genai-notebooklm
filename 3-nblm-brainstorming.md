# Brainstorming & Ideation for Resarch Questions
<img src="images/nblm-brain-storm.jpeg" style="float:right;width:400px;padding:10px;" alt="Brainstorm visualization">
In this workshop, we'll explore how GenAI can help you explore a group of journal articles and a video for gaps in the literature and potential research questions to fill those gaps or explore a related topic. 

> NOTE: Like all other Generative AI tools, NotebookLM will sometimes make mistakes, although because you are providing it with training data, it will likely make fewer mistakes than general purpose Generative AI tools. Always research any factual claims it makes if you are not a subject area expert. 

If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.

## Getting Started
Let's go back to the notebook with the three journal articles we've already created, and add a YouTube video to the notebook so that there will be four items for NotebookLM to draw information from:

1. Click on the **NotebookLM logo** on the top right of the screen, which will take you out of the current notebook and to the main NotebookLM screen.
2. Click on the **The Digital Badge Ecosystem in Libraries** notebook.
4. Click on the **Add Source** button above the list of journal articles in this notebook.<br>

5. Click on the **YouTube** button in the bottom middle of the page.<br>

## Initial Exploration  
1. Create a list of possible limitations or gaps in the articles and video by typing the following into the chat box and press Enter: ```What are the most significant limitations or gaps mentioned in these studies?```
  > - **Reflection**: Do the limitations and gaps look reasonable?
2. Identify some possible surprising or counterintuitive insights from the journal articles and video by typing the following into the chat box and press Enter: ```Extract 2-3 surprising or counterintuitive insights from these journal articles.```
  - **Reflection**: Are the insights supported by the citations that link to the parts of the article that support the insights?
3. Identify contradictory findings or interpretations between these journal articles. Type the following into the chat box and press Enter: ```Identify any contradictory findings or interpretations between these studies.```
  - **Reflection**: Are the contradictory findings supported by the citations?
4. Identify common themes or research questions shared by these articles. Type the following into the chat box and press Enter: ```What common themes or research questions emerge when examining these articles together?```
  - **Reflection**: Do the themes and research questions look reasonable based on what you've read in the articles?

## Research Question Generation  
1. Create a list of possible limitations or gaps in the articles and video by typing the following into the chat box and press Enter: ```What are the most significant limitations or gaps mentioned in these studies?```
  > - **Reflection**: Do the limitations and gaps look reasonable?
