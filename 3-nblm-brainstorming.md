# Brainstorming & Ideation
<img src="images/nblm-brain-storm.jpeg" style="float:right;width:400px;padding:10px;" alt="Brain storm visualization">
In this workshop, we'll explore how GenAI can help you quickly summarize meeting notes, including action items. We'll also discover how to customize these summaries by adjusting the tone, style, and language level. Have you ever needed to create a summary in a different language for a colleague or student? We'll show you how AI can translate your text with ease. 

> NOTE: Like all other Generative AI tools, NotebookLM will sometimes make mistakes, although because you are providing it with training data, it will likely make fewer mistakes than general purpose Generative AI tools. Always research any factual claims it makes if you are not a subject area expert. 

If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.

## Research: Brainstorming and Ideation  
1. Create a list of possible research questions based on the 3 journal articles by typing the following into the chat box and pressing Enter: ```Please generate a list of novel research questions  related to the topics in these journal articles, but not research questions in the articles.```
  > - **Reflection**: How do the research questions look?
  > - **Reflection**: Would you be tempted to use any as-is, or in a modified form?
